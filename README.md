# Android Map Example
A sample on how to use google maps on android.

## Instructions
These are the steps to run this sample:
1) Clone the repository
2) Create a Google Maps API key on the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
3) Replace the created API key on line 23 of the file `google_maps_api.xml`

*Note: It may not run properly on the Android Studio simulator due to the version of the Google Play Services installed. Running on an actual device is recommended.

That's it. You're good to go.
